# Java course

## Misc

You may want to install the better comments plugin or extension. This project uses Gradle.

Made with various online websites. OOP part: [Caleb Curry YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codebreakthrough "Caleb Curry"). Threads part: [Bro Code YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez "Bro Code").

An advanced part will be soon released in a new repository because of the complexity it needs. [Here's the link](https://github.com/Anto-Napo/java-advanced-course "Java advanced course"). However, only the network part is over.
